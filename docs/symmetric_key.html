        <h1>Symmetric Key Encryption</h1>
        <p>
          Symmetric key encryption is a type of encryption where the same key is used for both encrypting and decrypting the data. 
          This means that the sender and the recipient must both have access to the same key in order to communicate securely.
        </p>
        <p>
          Symmetric key encryption is typically faster and more efficient compared to asymmetric encryption, where different keys 
          are used for encryption and decryption. However, the challenge with symmetric key encryption lies in securely sharing 
          the key between the sender and the recipient to maintain the confidentiality of the communication.
        </p>
        <h1>Caesar Cipher</h1>
        <p>
          The Caesar Cipher is a simple example of symmetric key encryption. In this encryption technique, each letter in the plaintext 
          is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if we shift each letter in the alphabet by <strong>3 positions</strong>:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A becomes D</li>
          <li>B becomes E</li>
          <li>C becomes F</li>
          <li>and so on...</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          To encrypt a message using the Caesar Cipher, you choose a shift value (let's say 3 for this example) 
          and then replace each letter in the plaintext with the letter that appears three positions down the alphabet.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, if we want to encrypt the message <code>"HELLO"</code> with a shift of 3, it becomes <code>"KHOOR"</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To decrypt the message, the recipient would need to know the shift value (3 in this case) and 
          simply shift each letter in the ciphertext back up the alphabet by the same amount to 
          reveal the original message.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since both encryption and decryption rely on the same shift value, the Caesar Cipher is considered a symmetric 
          key encryption technique.
