        <h1>Asymmetric Key Encryption</h1>
        <p>
          Asymmetric key encryption is a method of secure communication that uses a pair of keys: 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>public key</strong>, which everyone has access to, </li>
          <li><strong>private key</strong>, which is kept secret by the user</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When someone wants to send a secure message, they encrypt it using the recipient's <strong>public key</strong>. 
          Once encrypted, this message can only be decrypted with the recipient's <strong>private key</strong>. This ensures 
          that even if someone intercepts the encrypted message, they cannot decrypt it without the <strong>private key</strong>. 
          This provides a powerful form of security in digital communications.
        </p>
        <h1>RSA Algorithm</h1>
        <p>
          RSA encryption is a type of public key cryptography developed by <strong>Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman</strong>. 
          It's built upon the mathematical challenge of factoring large composite numbers into their prime factors, 
          specifically the product of two large prime numbers. This creation of the public and private key pair involves 
          choosing these two large prime numbers and keeping them secret. A derivative number related to these primes is published as 
          the public key.
        </p>
        <p>
          Significantly, the security strength of the RSA system comes from the inherent difficulty and high computational cost 
          associated with the factorization of these large composite numbers. Thus, if large enough prime numbers are used, 
          the task of breaking RSA encryption becomes computationally infeasible, ensuring a robust security structure.
        </p>
        <p>
          RSA cryptography works in three main steps: key generation, encryption, and decryption. 
        </p>
        <h2>Key Generation</h2>
        <p>
          Key generation in RSA is a critical step involving several actions. First, two random <strong>prime</strong> numbers are selected, 
          usually designated as <code>p</code> and <code>q</code>. These should be of substantial size to ensure the security of the system. 
          They are then multiplied together to give a new number, <code>n = p * q</code>, creating the modulus for both the public and private keys.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, a calculation for a value known as <code>phi</code> is performed. This is <code>phi = (p-1)*(q-1)</code> and represents 
          the count of numbers that are relatively prime to <code>n</code>.
        </p> 
        <p>
          Third, a public exponent (often denoted as <code>e</code>) is chosen that has no factors in common with <code>(p-1)(q-1)</code> other than 
          <code>1</code>, which means it's relatively prime to <code>phi</code>. Often, <code>65537</code> is used as it is a prime number and makes 
          computation easier due to its form as a power of <code>2</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, the private key <code>d</code> is calculated. It is the multiplicative inverse of the public exponent modulo <code>phi</code>. 
          This means, <code>(d * e) % phi = 1</code>. The private key <code>d</code> is kept secret.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, the public key consists of <code>n</code> and <code>e</code>, and the private key is <code>d</code>. The security of RSA rests 
          largely on the difficulty in factoring the modulus <code>n</code> (product of <code>p</code> and <code>q</code>) back into its 
          constituent prime numbers <code>p</code> and <code>q</code>.
        </p>
        <h2>Encryption</h2>
        <p>
          The sender uses the recipient's public key (public exponent <code>e</code> and modulus <code>n</code> ) to encrypt the message. 
          The plaintext message is raised to the power of the public exponent, and the result is then divided by the modulus. 
          The remainder of this division (or modulus operation) is the encrypted message or the ciphertext.
        </p>
        <h2>Decryption</h2>
        <p>
          The recipient uses their private key to decrypt the encrypted message (private exponent <code>d</code> and modulus <code>n</code> ). 
          The ciphertext is raised to the power of the private key, and divided by the modulus. 
          The remainder of this division (or modulus operation) is the decrypted message or the plaintext.
        </p>
        <h2>Text Processing in RSA Encryption</h2>
        <p>
          In RSA encryption, a plaintext message needs to be converted into numeric form, since RSA fundamentally operates on numbers, not text. 
          This conversion is typically done through a process called <strong>encoding</strong>. Each character in your message might be 
          represented as an ASCII value, a system in which each character is represented by a unique number. 
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, <strong>A</strong> is <code>65</code>, <strong>B</strong> is <code>66</code>, and so on. Alternatively, 
          Unicode or another standard could be used. After the entire text is converted into a large number, RSA encryption is applied.
          When the decrypted message is received, it's then <strong>decoded</strong> back into its original text form using the same 
          character-to-number mapping. This ensures the encrypted numerical message translates back into the correct original text.
